                        <p class="card-text">You can find the sketchbook on the <a
                                href="{% url 'sketchbook' %}">sketchbook page</a>. We've tried to make it as easy and
                            intuitive as possible to use the sketchbook and all of the drawing tools, but if you'd like
                            some help you can push the "Help" button and take a tour of all of the sketchbook's
                            features.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">You can use the 'Undo' button to undo your last action on the sketchbook,
                            but only your last action - you can't step back through every line you've drawn.</p>
                        <p>Why just one? We want the sketchbook to feel fun and natural, like drawing on a real page.
                            But there's nothing fun about your hand slipping while you're working on some fine detail,
                            or flooding half your canvas with the fill tool when you thought you'd clicked on the
                            pencil, so we added an undo you can use to take back big mistakes.</p>

                            drawing you'd like to load, then click "Load" to load it onto your sketchbook. This will
                            overwrite anything currently drawn on your sketchbook, so make sure you've saved anything
                            you want to keep!</p>
                        <p>If you just want to admire your saved doodles without loading them onto your sketchbook, you
                            can view them in the <a href="{% url 'profile' %}#gallery">Gallery section</a> of your
                            Account page. Or, better yet, why not <a href="{% url 'show_all_prints' %}">buy a print</a>
                            so you can have a permanent reminder of your artistic genius?</p>

                            Alternatively, you can simply save over any doodles that you don't want to keep with new
